In this project, My team and I developed a model to predict air quality categories (Baik, Sedang, & Tidak Baik) based on pollutants contained in the air. The Dataset used is Indeks Kualitas Udara Jakarta Tahun 2021-2023 taken from Satudata Jakarta website. The raw dataset was cleaned during the preprocessing phase by handling missing data and removing unnecessary attributes. The processed data was then used to train, evaluate, and test the model. We applied two machine learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest."
